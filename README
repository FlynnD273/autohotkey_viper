This project implements vi like keys for any arbitrary editor like app on
windows as far as possible.

Eg w es emulated by <c-right> and e is emulated by <c-right> <left>

This is a rewrite of 
  http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic44762.html 
cleaning up the code removing much repetition.


implement visual selection mode (needs state)

implement things like { } etc. Strategy: Copy whole buffer to clipboard, use
shift-END or such to find position of cursor
using this "current" line calculate movement options


Note: Don't think that this comes even close to Vim features. But it works everywhere

While this all is an option this prototype shows that even 20l is too slow to be of real use.
You don't want to wait for your editor.

TODO:
- make it switch off vi mode if user changes app manually eg by alt-tab
