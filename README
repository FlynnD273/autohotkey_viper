Changes made:
The disabled mode works far better now. Instead of re-sending input when a hotkey is triggered, this uses #If regions to completely disable the hotkeys. 
I ran into issues where the previous method of disabling would interfere with some video games. 
I also added in logic to prevent Vim mode from being entered when VALORANT is open. 
I'd like to eventually extend this to just use a list of blacklisted programs in a separate file, but I don't want ot have to figure that out right now.

This project implements vi like keys for any arbitrary editor like app on
windows as far as possible.

Eg w es emulated by <c-right> and e is emulated by <c-right> <left>

This is a rewrite of 
  http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic44762.html 
cleaning up the code removing much repetition.


TODO:
implement searches:
/?*# (depend on window. Probably ctl-f can be used almost everywhere, but setting forward / backward might be different)

implement visual selection mode (needs state)


implement things like { } etc. Strategy: Copy whole buffer to clipboard, use
shift-END or such to find position of cursor
using this "current" line calculate movement options



Note: Don't think that this comes even close to Vim features. But it works everywhere
