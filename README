This project implements vi like keys for any arbitrary editor like app on
windows as far as possible.

Eg w es emulated by <c-right> and e is emulated by <c-right> <left>

This is a rewrite of 
  http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic44762.html

cleaning up the code removing much repetition.


TODO:
implement searches:
/?*# (depend on window. Probably ctl-f can be used almost everywhere, but setting forward / backward might be different)

implement visual selection mode (needs state)


implement things like { } etc. Strategy: Copy whole buffer to clipboard, use shift-END or such to find position of cursor
using this "current" line calculate movement options
